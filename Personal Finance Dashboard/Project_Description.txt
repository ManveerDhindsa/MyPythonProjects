This program creates a personal finance dashboard.

I have downloaded a file from Questrade investing platform. (I have not included it for security reasons)

When this program is run a table will display with the transaction date and the net amount of the dividends received to the account.

This will then be plotted in a bar chart.

With the average dividend given at the bottom.

To run this software use the command line prompt: streamlit run personal_finance_dashboard.py
