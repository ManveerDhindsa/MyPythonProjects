This game gives you letters the same way you would get in scrabble.

You make a word from those letters and a score is given based on that words length and character combination.

All words are found in words_ps4.txt
This is to make sure the word created is a real word and can be checked from this list.

The user is asked if they want to play the previous hand, play a new hand or exit the game
The game continues until the user can't make a word or the letters in the hand run out.

You can run the program again to play again.
