The goal of this project was to ask the user for an item they are looking for on amazon and their budget.
Using this the program would find the best price to rating ratio to determine the best product from products that have a minimum of 100 reviews.
The first page results were used as the first page typically has the best products.

The URL and Name of the product are returned in the end if a product matching the criteria is found.
